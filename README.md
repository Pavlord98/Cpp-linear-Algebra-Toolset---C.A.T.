# linAlg

This is a project of mine in which I am developing my own linear algebra library for personal use and practice.

## Current Features

* A templated matrix class for different data types 
* Support for the basic matrix operations via overloaded operators " (), +, -, *, = "
* Many methods for getting information regarding created matrices
* Support for initilazing Identity, Ones and Zeros matrices of any size
* Matrix inversion by the Gauss-Jordan method
* Joining and splitting matrices

## Features currently in development

* Advanced indexing and slicing of matrices

## Upcoming feutures

* Methods for solving linear systems 
* Special methods for sparse matrices
* Recreated solvers used in OpenFOAM
* QR decomposition
* Doxygen documentation

## Known buggs
* << overload does something weird, print() method works fine
